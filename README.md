# This is a camera calculator app developed by using text detection and image classifications. To use this app, the user will first select a photo containing a handwritten number, then select one calculation type (plus, minus, multiply or divide), and then select another also containing a handwritten number. The app will recognize the two numbers, and them perform the selected calculation and return the result.
